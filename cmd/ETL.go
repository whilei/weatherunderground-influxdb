	Use:   "ETL",
	Short: "A brief description of your command",
	Long: `A longer description that spans multiple lines and likely contains examples
and usage of using your command. For example:

Cobra is a CLI library for Go that empowers applications.
This application is a tool to generate the needed files
to quickly create a Cobra application.`,
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
		fmt.Println("ETL called")
		// fmt.Println(cmd.ParseFlags(args)) // This is unnecessary, but harmless.
		fmt.Println(cmd.PersistentFlags().GetString("foo"))
		fmt.Println(cmd.Flags().GetBool("toggle"))

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	ETLCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	ETLCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
